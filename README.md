# The problem

You want a URL shortener for your custom domain and you want an easy way to create and update URLs but you don't want to pay hundreds of dollars a year.

# This solution

This relies on Netlify's `_redirects` file for building a super simple URL shortener where the URLs are managed on GitHub and Netlify handles the redirecting for you.

See Kent C. Dodds faboulous [https://github.com/kentcdodds/netlify-shortener](netlify-shortener) or his [https://github.com/kentcdodds/netlify-shortener-example](example repository). This repository just reuses his idea.
